# Index-with-Equal-Left-and-Right-Sums

I can't believe this works. 💆‍♀️🤯

***Question: Given a list of integer nums, return the earliest index i such that the sum of the numbers left of i is equal to the sum of numbers right of i. If there's no solution, return -1.***

So it's basically an **index equilibrium** question. 

We start with the left sum being 0 and the right sum being the total of the whole array. With every intention we'll subtract one element from the total. If this makes both the left and right sums equal then we return i. Or else we move leftwards and add.

This was pretty cool 😐. I can't believe I'm being this nerdy 🤓.
